Run the full morning pre-market analysis workflow. Execute these steps:

1. Run `uv run tradekit morning` to scan pre-market and analyze top picks
2. Review the output and summarize findings in a table with columns: Ticker, Score, Gap%, PreMkt Vol, Key Levels, Setup Quality (A/B/C/F)
3. Highlight the top 2-3 actionable setups with suggested entry zone, stop loss, and target levels
4. Note any tickers with unusual characteristics (extreme gap, very high relative volume, low float)

Present results concisely — this is for a 7:45 AM pre-market session.
