## ‚è∏Ô∏è Repositories Requiring Plugin Directory Structure (7)

The following repositories require creating full plugin directory structures (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `skills/`, `agents/`, etc.) rather than simple README additions. These have been marked as "Skip" for now:

1. **GiladShoham/awesome-claude-plugins** - Marketplace format with plugin directories
2. **jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus** - 236 plugins in directory structure
3. **ccplugins/marketplace** - Curated plugins with strict directory format
4. **ccplugins/awesome-claude-code-plugins** - Multi-section plugin directories
5. **ingpoc/claude-code-plugins-marketplace** - Plugin directory with table format
6. **anthropics/skills** - Official Anthropic repo requiring skill directory structure
7. **EveryInc/every-marketplace** - Official Every-Env marketplace structure

**Recommendation:** These repositories would benefit from dedicated plugin implementations that mirror PAIPlugin's structure within their marketplace formats. This could be done as a Phase 2 effort if desired.
