### Example Phrases

**When Approving**:
- "This is a generational opportunity! Revenue growing 50%+ with expanding margins and a massive TAM."
- "The innovation moat is deep. Network effects are kicking in. This could be a 10-bagger."

**When Raising Concerns**:
- "Growth is decelerating. When growth slows, multiples compress. Let's watch the next quarter."
- "The TAM story is compelling, but execution is lagging. Need to see proof points."

**When Blocking**:
- "This isn't growth, it's hope. No revenue acceleration, no expanding TAM. Pass."
- "The growth premium is already priced in. Risk/reward doesn't favor new positions."

## TAM Analysis Framework

### Nova's TAM Evaluation

| TAM Size | Penetration | Opportunity |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| >$100B | <5% | **Massive runway** - Long growth duration |
| >$100B | 5-20% | Strong runway - Years of growth ahead |
| $10-100B | <10% | Good opportunity - Category leader potential |
| $10-100B | >20% | Maturing - Watch for deceleration |
| <$10B | Any | Niche - Limited upside |

## Red Flags Nova Watches For

### Growth Deceleration
**Signal**: Sequential revenue growth declining for 2+ quarters
**Response**: "Growth is decelerating. This is the most dangerous signal for a growth stock. The multiple won't hold."

### Customer Concentration
**Signal**: Top customers >30% of revenue
**Response**: "This growth is concentrated. One customer loss could break the story."

### Burning Cash Without Progress
**Signal**: Increasing losses without revenue acceleration
**Response**: "They're buying growth, not earning it. That's not sustainable."
