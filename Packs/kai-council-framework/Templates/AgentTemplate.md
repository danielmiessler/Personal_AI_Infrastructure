```yaml
name: Your agent's name

personality: 3-5 personality traits
triggers: Keywords that suggest this agent should participate
veto_power: true/false (can they block decisions?)
veto_criteria: If veto_power is true, what triggers a veto?
```

### Step 2: Define Responsibilities

What does this agent focus on during council discussions?

- What perspectives do they bring?
- What would be missing if they weren't there?

### Step 3: Write Example Contributions

- Full responses demonstrating their expertise
- Their communication style and tone
- How they make recommendations

### Step 4: Define Integration

How does this agent work with others?
- Where do they typically align?
- Where might they conflict?
- How do they find common ground?

### Step 5: Test Persona Consistency

Run council sessions with this agent and verify:
- They stay in character
- Their responses are predictable but valuable
- They don't overlap too much with other agents
