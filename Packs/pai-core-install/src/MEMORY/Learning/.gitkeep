# Learning Directory - Phase-Based Synthesis (WARM)

Learnings organized by algorithm phase for targeted retrieval.

Content bubbles up from Work/ when it's:

- Algorithm-focused
- Actionable
- Non-obvious

Subdirectories by phase:
- OBSERVE/ - Context-gathering insights
- THINK/ - Hypothesis generation learnings
- PLAN/ - Execution planning lessons
- BUILD/ - Success criteria documentation
- EXECUTE/ - Implementation insights
- VERIFY/ - Verification learnings
- ALGORITHM/ - Meta-learnings about the algorithm itself
