# Work Directory - Per-Task Active Tracking (HOT)

This directory contains real-time traces for current tasks.

Each task gets its own timestamped directory with:
- Work.md - Goals and signal tracking
- IdealState.jsonl - Success criteria evolution
- TRACE.jsonl - Decision reasoning logs
- Output/ - Task outputs
- Learning/ - Task-specific learnings

Learnings "bubble up" to ../Learning/ when generalizable.
