# Azure Pentest - Example Client

Working on Azure cloud penetration test for Example Client.

**Tenant:** example.onmicrosoft.com
**Creds:** See Azure Creds.md
**Status:** Enumeration phase
**Started:** 2026-01-20

## What I'm focused on

- Enumerating Azure AD users and roles
- Looking for privilege escalation paths
- Storage account misconfigurations
- Key vault access

## Key findings so far

- Found 3 accounts with Global Administrator role
- Storage account "publicdata" has anonymous read access
- Key vault "prod-secrets" accessible by service principal

## Relevant skills

- `/azure-enum` for command help
- `/roadtools-helper` for Azure AD deep dive
- `/azurehound-helper` for attack path analysis
- `/azure-findings` for documenting findings

## Notes

Free-form notes, observations, whatever helps...

- User enumeration completed
- Need to check for privilege escalation via app registrations
- Review conditional access policies

## Files in this vault

- `Azure Creds.md` - Credentials (gitignored)
- `Commands.md` - Reusable command library
- `Findings.md` - Documented vulnerabilities
- `Notes.md` - Running session notes
- `outputs/` - Tool outputs and evidence
