## What's Included

### Skill: internal-pentest

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **SKILL.md** | Methodology guidance, phase detection, attack path recommendations |
| **Scripts/initial-discovery.sh** | Phase 0: Zero-arg situational awareness (IP, DNS, domain, DCs) |
| **Scripts/network-discovery.sh** | Phase 1: Host discovery, port scanning, SMB enumeration |
| **Scripts/ad-enum.sh** | Phase 2: AD enumeration, ADCS, BloodHound, trust mapping |
| **Scripts/bloodhound-collection.sh** | Phase 2: BloodHound data collection |
| **Scripts/credential-attacks.sh** | Phase 3: Responder, relay, spray, Kerberoast |
| **Scripts/deploy-remote.sh** | Deploy scripts to remote Kali via SCP |
| **Scripts/retrieve-results.sh** | Pull results back from remote Kali |

### 8 Workflow Guides

| Workflow | Phase |
|----------|-------|
| Initialize.md | Project setup with VAULT.md, Scope, Commands, Notes |
| Methodology.md | 5-phase assessment structure and transitions |
| NetworkDiscovery.md | Phase 1 detailed guidance |
| ADEnumeration.md | Phase 2 detailed guidance |
| CredentialAttacks.md | Phase 3 detailed guidance |
| LateralMovement.md | Phase 4 detailed guidance |
| PostExploitation.md | Phase 5 reporting and evidence |
| RemoteDeploy.md | Deploy/retrieve workflow for remote Kali testing |

## Architecture

```
PROJECT MANAGEMENT
└── Initialize.md → Creates VAULT.md, Scope.md, Commands.md, Notes.md

PHASE 0: INITIAL DISCOVERY
└── initial-discovery.sh → IP, subnet, DNS, domain, DCs (13 enum methods)

PHASE 1: NETWORK DISCOVERY
└── network-discovery.sh → Ping sweep, port scan, SMB signing, service ID

PHASE 2: AD ENUMERATION
├── ad-enum.sh → Users, groups, GPOs, ADCS, delegation, DNS
└── bloodhound-collection.sh → BloodHound data collection

PHASE 3: CREDENTIAL ATTACKS
└── credential-attacks.sh → Responder, relay, spray, Kerberoast, AS-REP

PHASE 4-5: LATERAL MOVEMENT & REPORTING
└── Workflow guidance (no automation scripts — too context-dependent)

REMOTE DEPLOYMENT
├── deploy-remote.sh → Package + SCP scripts to remote Kali
└── retrieve-results.sh → Rsync results back for local analysis
```

## Requirements

- Kali Linux (recommended) or any Linux with:
  - nmap, netexec, python3, dig/nslookup
  - Optional: ldapsearch, smbclient, rpcclient, nbtscan, certipy, impacket, responder
