# Image Reconnaissance Workflow

Comprehensive image/photo OSINT analysis including metadata extraction, reverse search, and manipulation detection.

## Trigger Phrases
- "analyze image"
- "image OSINT"
- "reverse image search"
- "check photo metadata"
- "image forensics"
- "where was this photo taken"
- "is this image real"
- "photo reconnaissance"

## Input
- `image`: File path or URL to the image to analyze

## Process

### Step 1: Image Validation

**Local Tool Commands:**
```bash
# Detect file type (magic bytes, not extension)
file --mime-type <image_path>

# Get detailed file info
file -b <image_path>

# Calculate file hashes for tracking/verification
md5 <image_path>
shasum -a 256 <image_path>

# Get image dimensions and format details (ImageMagick)
identify -verbose <image_path> | head -50

# Check for corruption (returns error if corrupted)
identify -regard-warnings <image_path>

# Get file size
ls -lh <image_path>
stat -f "%z bytes" <image_path>
```

**Validation Checks:**
- Confirm file type (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, HEIC, WebP, RAW)
- Check file dimensions and resolution
- Verify file is not corrupted
- Calculate file hash (MD5, SHA256) for tracking
- Check file size and compression

### Step 2: EXIF/Metadata Extraction
```
Extract all embedded metadata:

Camera Information:
- Camera make and model
- Lens information
- Focal length, aperture, ISO, shutter speed
- Flash used

Location Data:
- GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude, altitude)
- GPS timestamp
- Location name (if embedded)

Temporal Data:
- Date/time original taken
- Date/time digitized
- Modification timestamps
- Time zone information

Software & Processing:
- Software used for editing
- Processing history
- Color profile
- Compression settings

Ownership:
- Copyright notice
- Author/artist name
- Credit information
- Usage rights
```

### Step 3: Reverse Image Search
```
Search across multiple engines for matches:

1. Google Images:
   - Visual matches
   - Similar images
   - Pages containing image

2. TinEye:
   - Exact matches with modification detection
   - Oldest known occurrence
   - Image usage history

3. Yandex Images:
   - Strong for faces and locations
   - Eastern European content coverage

4. Bing Visual Search:
   - Similar images
   - Related content

5. Specialized Engines:
   - Getty Images (stock photo matching)
   - Shutterstock (stock photo detection)
   - PimEyes (face matching - if applicable)

Compile Results:
- First appearance date
- Total occurrences found
- Domains where image appears
- Modifications/crops detected
```

### Step 4: Facial Analysis
```
If faces detected in image:

Face Detection:
- Number of faces detected
- Face locations in image
- Face quality/resolution

Identity Research (Public Sources Only):
- Reverse facial search (PimEyes, public databases)
- Social media profile matching
- News article appearances

Demographic Estimation:
- Approximate age range
- Expression analysis

Note: Only use publicly available facial recognition
services and respect privacy regulations.
```

### Step 5: Manipulation Detection
```
Analyze image authenticity:

Error Level Analysis (ELA):
- Compression level inconsistencies
- Edited regions detection
- Copy-paste artifacts

Metadata Consistency:
- Software version plausibility
- Timestamp coherence
- Camera model vs. image specs match
- GPS data vs. claimed location

Clone Detection:
- Repeated patterns indicating cloning
- Heal/patch tool artifacts

AI Generation Detection:
- GAN fingerprint analysis
- Diffusion model artifacts
- Unnatural patterns (fingers, text, reflections)
- Frequency domain analysis

Splicing Detection:
- Lighting inconsistency
- Shadow direction analysis
- Perspective anomalies
- Edge artifacts

Output Confidence:
- Authentic | Modified | AI-Generated | Inconclusive
- Confidence percentage
- Specific anomalies found
```

### Step 6: Context/Location Analysis
```
Identify location from image content:

Landmark Recognition:
- Buildings, monuments, statues
- Natural landmarks
- Notable infrastructure

Text/Signage Analysis:
- Street signs, store names
- Language identification
- Phone number formats (country codes)

Environmental Clues:
- Vegetation type (climate indicators)
- Sun position (time/latitude estimation)
- Weather conditions
- Season indicators

Architectural Style:
- Building design era
- Regional architecture patterns
- Window/door styles
- Roofing materials

Vehicle Analysis:
- License plate format (country/state)
- Vehicle makes common to region
- Traffic patterns (left/right drive)

Shadow Analysis:
- Sun angle for time estimation
- Date range estimation based on sun position
- Hemisphere determination
```

### Step 7: Store to Knowledge Graph

Use the **knowledge** skill to persist the findings:

```
Store the following as structured episodes:

1. Image Entity:
   - Name: "Image: {hash_short}"
   - Data: File hash, dimensions, format, capture date, source URL
   - Group: "osint-images"

2. Metadata Entity:
   - Name: "Metadata: {hash_short}"
   - Data: Camera info, GPS coords, timestamps, software, copyright
   - Relationships: metadata_for image entity

3. Location Entity (if determined):
   - Name: "Location: {coordinates_or_name}"
   - Data: GPS coordinates, landmark names, confidence level, method
   - Relationships: captured_at image entity, located_in region

4. Reverse Search Results:
   - Name: "Appearances: {hash_short}"
   - Data: First seen date, occurrence count, domains list
   - Relationships: appears_on domain entities

5. Faces Entity (if applicable):
   - Name: "Faces: {hash_short}"
   - Data: Face count, potential matches, confidence levels
   - Relationships: depicts person entities

6. Authenticity Entity:
   - Name: "Authenticity: {hash_short}"
   - Data: Manipulation score, AI detection, ELA results, anomalies
   - Relationships: validates image entity
```
