# Intelligence Report Workflow

Generate structured intelligence reports from collected OSINT data.

## Trigger Phrases
- "generate report"
- "intel report"
- "create dossier"
- "summarize findings"
- "investigation summary"

## Input
- `investigation_name`: Name/identifier for the investigation
- `targets` (optional): Specific targets to include
- `format` (optional): Output format (markdown, pdf, json)

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Intelligence
```
Query knowledge graph for:
- All entities related to investigation
- Facts and relationships
- Timeline of collection
- Source attribution
```

### Step 2: Organize by Category
```
Structure findings:
1. Executive Summary
2. Target Overview
3. Digital Footprint
4. Network Analysis
5. Timeline
6. Risk Assessment
7. Recommendations
8. Appendices
```

### Step 3: Generate Sections

**Executive Summary**
- Key findings (3-5 bullet points)
- Confidence level
- Scope of investigation

**Target Overview**
- Primary identifiers
- Known aliases
- Platform presence

**Digital Footprint**
- Domains owned/associated
- Social media accounts
- Online activity summary

**Network Analysis**
- Key relationships
- Organizations
- Geographic associations

**Timeline**
- Account creation dates
- Activity patterns
- Notable events

**Risk Assessment**
- Threat indicators
- Exposure level
- Vulnerabilities identified

### Step 4: Add Metadata
```
Report metadata:
- Generation date
- Analyst (AI)
- Sources used
- Confidence levels
- Classification
```

### Step 5: Export
```
Save to:
- $PAI_DIR/history/research/osint/[investigation_name]/
- Knowledge graph (report entity)
```

### Step 6: Store to Knowledge Graph

Use the **knowledge** skill to persist the report:

```
Store the following as structured episodes:

1. Report Entity:
   - Name: "Report: {investigation_name}"
   - Data: Report ID, date, classification, scope, key findings summary
   - Group: "osint-reports"

2. Target Summary:
   - Name: "Target: {investigation_name}"
   - Data: All targets included, primary identifiers, platform presence
   - Links to individual target profiles

3. Findings:
   - Name: "Findings: {investigation_name}"
   - Data: Digital footprint, network analysis, timeline, risk assessment
   - Confidence levels and source counts

4. Recommendations:
   - Name: "Recommendations: {investigation_name}"
   - Data: Action items, follow-up suggestions
   - Priority levels

5. Sources & Methodology:
   - Name: "Sources: {investigation_name}"
   - Data: All sources used, collection methods, ethical compliance
   - Audit trail
```
