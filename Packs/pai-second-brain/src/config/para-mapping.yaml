# PARA to PAI Memory System Mapping
#
# This configuration maps PARA folder structure to PAI's three-tier memory system.
# Works with any folder containing PARA structure (Obsidian, plain markdown, etc.)
#
# Set your vault location:
#   vault_root: "/path/to/your/para/folder"
# Or use environment variable: PARA_VAULT

# Schema version
version: "1.0.0"

# PARA folder structure
# Maps each PARA category to its cognitive function and PAI memory tier
