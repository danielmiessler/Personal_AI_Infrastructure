playbooks:
  - name: Opening Range Breakout (ORB)
    id: orb
    category: momentum
    timeframe: "9:30-10:00 range"
    description: >
      Stock establishes a range in the first 15-30 minutes, then breaks out
      with volume. Trade the breakout direction with a stop below the range.
    criteria:
      - Stock has a catalyst (earnings, news, upgrade)
      - Gap up/down >2% on above-average pre-market volume
      - Clean opening range forms in first 15-30 minutes
      - Relative volume (RVOL) > 2.0 at breakout
    entry_rules:
      - Enter on break above/below the opening range high/low
      - Confirm with volume surge (>1.5x average bar volume)
      - Wait for a 1-min candle to close outside the range
    stop_rules:
      - Stop at opposite side of the opening range
      - If range is too wide (>2% of price), use VWAP as stop
      - Max risk per share should stay within RiskRules limits
    target_rules:
      - Target 1 (1R): Equal to risk distance from entry
      - Target 2 (2R): 2x risk distance — take partial profits
      - Target 3 (3R+): Trail stop using 5-min moving average or VWAP
    notes:
      - Best in first 30 minutes after the range establishes
      - Avoid if the range is choppy or volume is declining
      - Works best on stocks gapping into new highs/lows

  - name: VWAP Reclaim
    id: vwap-reclaim
    category: mean-reversion
    timeframe: "10:00+"
    description: >
      Stock sells off below VWAP early in the session, then reclaims VWAP
      with conviction. Trade the reclaim as a mean-reversion long.
    criteria:
      - Stock was strong pre-market but sold off after open
      - Price dips below VWAP on declining volume
      - Stock holds a higher low near a key support level
      - Volume picks up as price approaches VWAP from below
    entry_rules:
      - Enter on first 1-min close above VWAP after the reclaim
      - Alternatively, enter on pullback to VWAP after initial reclaim
      - Confirmation: increasing bid-side volume
    stop_rules:
      - Stop just below the higher low that preceded the reclaim
      - Or stop at LOD (low of day) if it's within risk tolerance
      - Tight stop — this is a precision setup
    target_rules:
      - Target 1 (1R): Pre-market high or morning high
      - Target 2 (2R): New HOD push
      - Target 3: Trail with VWAP — if it holds above, stay in
    notes:
      - Most reliable between 10:00-11:30 AM
      - Avoid if overall market is weak and trending down
      - Stronger when stock has positive catalyst

  - name: First Pullback (Bull Flag)
    id: first-pullback
    category: momentum
    timeframe: "9:45-11:00"
    description: >
      After a strong opening move, stock pulls back on low volume forming
      a bull flag pattern. Enter on the breakout of the flag.
    criteria:
      - Strong opening move (>3% from open) on heavy volume
      - Pullback on declining volume (flag portion)
      - Flag holds above VWAP or key intraday support
      - Duration of flag: 5-15 minutes typical
    entry_rules:
      - Enter on break above the flag high with volume confirmation
      - Can enter at the bottom of the flag if support is very clear
      - Use a 1-min chart for precise entry timing
    stop_rules:
      - Stop below the flag low
      - If flag low is below VWAP, use VWAP as stop instead
      - Risk should not exceed 1% of stock price
    target_rules:
      - Target 1 (1R): Measured move equal to the initial leg up
      - Target 2 (2R): Extension to next resistance level
      - Target 3: Trail stop behind each new higher low
    notes:
      - The FIRST pullback is the highest-probability one
      - Later pullbacks have diminishing returns
      - Best on stocks making new 52-week highs on catalyst

  - name: Red to Green
    id: red-to-green
    category: reversal
    timeframe: "First 2 hours"
    description: >
      Stock gaps down or opens red, finds a bottom, then reverses through
      the previous close (red to green move). Trade the reversal.
    criteria:
      - Stock opens red (below previous close) on news/earnings
      - Selling volume exhausts in first 15-30 minutes
      - Price forms a clear bottoming pattern (double bottom, hammer)
      - Relative strength vs sector/market appears
    entry_rules:
      - Enter on break above previous close (the "green" level)
      - Or enter at the confirmed bottom with stop below LOD
      - Volume should increase on the reversal candles
    stop_rules:
      - Stop below the intraday low (the confirmed bottom)
      - If LOD is too far, use the most recent higher low
      - This is a wider-stop setup — size down accordingly
    target_rules:
      - Target 1 (1R): Gap fill level or pre-market high
      - Target 2 (2R): Previous day's high
      - Target 3: Extended move if catalyst supports it
    notes:
      - Works best when the gap down was an overreaction
      - Avoid if the stock has genuine fundamental problems
      - Watch for short squeeze acceleration on the reversal

  - name: Breakdown Short
    id: breakdown-short
    category: momentum
    timeframe: Any
    description: >
      Stock loses a key support level (VWAP, prior day low, consolidation low)
      on increasing volume. Short the breakdown.
    criteria:
      - Stock is weak relative to the market
      - Approaching a clear support level with declining bounces
      - Volume increases on down moves, decreases on bounces
      - No major support levels close below (room to fall)
    entry_rules:
      - Short on break below the support level
      - Confirm with volume (>1.5x average on the breakdown bar)
      - Or short the first lower-high retest of broken support
    stop_rules:
      - Stop above the broken support level (now resistance)
      - Or stop above the most recent lower high
      - Keep stops tight — breakdowns can reverse quickly
    target_rules:
      - Target 1 (1R): Next support level below
      - Target 2 (2R): Measured move equal to the prior consolidation range
      - Target 3: Trail stop above each new lower high
    notes:
      - Strongest when overall market is also weak
      - Avoid shorting into major support (200 DMA, round numbers)
      - Best after 10:30 AM when morning buying pressure fades
