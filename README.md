## *"This project exists so that the best AI in the world is not only used by a few, but can be used by everyone."*

</div>

Right now the most powerful AI setups are being built inside companies with massive engineering teams. That's backwards. These tools should be available to individuals—to you—so you can build your own AI system that actually knows how you work.

That's what PAI is. It's the scaffolding for building a personal AI that gets better over time because it's *yours*. Not some generic chatbot. Your system, your skills, your workflows.

---

## 🎯 **What is PAI?**

PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure) is an open-source template for building your own AI-powered operating system using Claude Code.

**Core Primitives:**
- **Skills** - Self-contained AI capabilities with routing, workflows, and documentation
- **Agents** - Specialized AI personalities for different tasks (engineer, researcher, designer, etc.)
- **Hooks** - Event-driven automation that captures work, provides voice feedback, and manages state

**Approach:** Start clean, small, and simple. Build the scaffolding that makes AI reliable.

---

## 🔄 **PAI vs Kai: What You Get**

**PAI (this repository) provides:**
- ✅ Skills/agents/hooks architecture
- ✅ CORE documentation and routing
- ✅ History system (UOCS) for automatic documentation
- ✅ Example skills (research, fabric, etc.)
- ✅ Voice server skeleton
- ⚙️ **Requires:** API key configuration per skill

**Kai (Daniel's private system) adds:**
- 🔒 Personal data, contacts, and history
- 🔒 Additional private skills and workflows
- 🔒 Customized agent personalities and voices
- 🔒 Production integrations and automations

**Think of it this way:** PAI is the scaffolding. You build your own "Kai" on top of it.

**After setup, PAI should:**
- ✅ Execute hooks without errors
- ✅ Load CORE context at session start
- ✅ Route skills correctly
- ✅ Capture session history
- ✅ Launch agents successfully

**Not working?** Run the health check:
```bash
bun ${PAI_DIR}/hooks/self-test.ts
```

See `PAI_CONTRACT.md` for complete details on what's guaranteed vs what needs configuration.

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### 1. Install Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Bun (PAI's package manager)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Install Claude Code
# Follow instructions at: https://code.claude.com
```

### 2. Clone and Configure

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure.git
cd Personal_AI_Infrastructure

# Copy environment template
cp .claude/.env.example .claude/.env

# Edit .env and add your API keys
# At minimum: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### 3. Copy to Your System

```bash
# Backup existing Claude config (if any)
[ -d ~/.claude ] && mv ~/.claude ~/.claude.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Copy PAI's .claude directory to your home
cp -r .claude ~/.claude
```

**Alternative: Symlink** (keeps PAI updatable via git pull)
```bash
[ -d ~/.claude ] && mv ~/.claude ~/.claude.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
ln -s $(pwd)/.claude ~/.claude
```

### 4. Start Claude Code

```bash
# PAI loads automatically via the CORE skill
claude
```

**That's it!** The CORE skill loads at session start and provides all PAI functionality.

📚 **For detailed setup:** See `docs/QUICKSTART.md`

---

## 📚 **Documentation**

**All documentation lives in the CORE skill** (`.claude/skills/CORE/`):

### **Essential Reading**

- **[CONSTITUTION.md](.claude/skills/CORE/CONSTITUTION.md)** - System philosophy, architecture, and operating principles
- **[SKILL.md](.claude/skills/CORE/SKILL.md)** - Main PAI skill with identity, preferences, and quick reference
- **[SKILL-STRUCTURE-AND-ROUTING.md](.claude/skills/CORE/SKILL-STRUCTURE-AND-ROUTING.md)** - How to create your own skills

### **System Guides**

- **[hook-system.md](.claude/skills/CORE/hook-system.md)** - Event-driven automation
- **[history-system.md](.claude/skills/CORE/history-system.md)** - Automatic work documentation
- **[VOICE.md](.claude/skills/CORE/VOICE.md)** → **[voice-server/README.md](.claude/voice-server/README.md)** - Text-to-speech feedback

### **Reference**

- **[prosody-guide.md](.claude/skills/CORE/prosody-guide.md)** - Voice emotion system
- **[prompting.md](.claude/skills/CORE/prompting.md)** - Prompt engineering patterns
- **[terminal-tabs.md](.claude/skills/CORE/terminal-tabs.md)** - Terminal management

## 🎨 **Examples**

Explore example skills in `.claude/skills/`:

- **`brightdata/`** - Four-tier progressive web scraping with automatic fallback (WebFetch → cURL → Playwright → Bright Data MCP)
- **`fabric/`** - Integration with Fabric pattern system (242+ AI patterns)
- **`research/`** - Multi-source research workflows
- **`create-skill/`** - Templates for creating new skills
- **`alex-hormozi-pitch/`** - Business pitch generation
- **`ffuf/`** - Web fuzzing and security testing

Each skill demonstrates the skills-as-containers pattern with routing, workflows, and self-contained documentation.

---

## 🏗️ **Architecture**

PAI is built on three foundational principles:

### **1. Command Line First**
Build deterministic CLI tools, then wrap them with AI orchestration. Code is cheaper, faster, and more reliable than prompts.

### **2. Skills as Containers**
Package domain expertise in self-activating, self-contained modules. Natural language triggers automatic routing to the right skill.

### **3. Progressive Disclosure**
Load context only when needed (3 tiers):
- **Tier 1:** System prompt (always active, 200-500 words)
- **Tier 2:** SKILL.md (on-demand, comprehensive reference)
- **Tier 3:** Reference files (just-in-time, deep dives)

**Complete architecture:** See `.claude/skills/CORE/CONSTITUTION.md`

---

## 🛠️ **Technology Stack**

- **Runtime:** Bun (NOT Node.js)
- **Language:** TypeScript (NOT Python - we're TypeScript zealots)
- **Package Manager:** Bun (NOT npm/yarn/pnpm)
- **Format:** Markdown (NOT HTML for basic content)
- **Testing:** Vitest when needed
- **Voice:** ElevenLabs TTS integration

---

## 🔐 **Security**

**IMPORTANT:** This is a PUBLIC template repository with sanitized examples.

**DO NOT commit:**
- API keys or secrets
- Personal email addresses or contact information
- Private repository references
- Any sensitive personal data

See `SECURITY.md` for complete security protocols.
