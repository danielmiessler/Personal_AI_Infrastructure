## What Changed

v2.4 introduced The Algorithm—a 7-phase approach to problem-solving with verifiable criteria. It worked, but it had blind spots: it picked capabilities based on habit rather than analysis, it skipped thinking tools without justification, and it ran independent tasks one at a time when they could have run simultaneously.

v2.5 fixes all three.

### The Problem v2.5 Solves

v2.4's Algorithm:
```
Pick familiar tools → Execute sequentially → Hope the right capabilities were chosen
```

v2.5's Algorithm:
```
Hook suggests capabilities → Reverse-engineer true intent → Validate suggestions against ISC →
Justify every tool inclusion/exclusion → Execute independent work in parallel → Verify
```

The difference is metacognition. The Algorithm now thinks about *how* it thinks before it acts.

---

## Three Major Features

### 1. Two-Pass Capability Selection

Previously, capability selection happened implicitly—the system defaulted to familiar patterns (usually Engineer + Research) regardless of what the task actually needed.

Now selection happens in two explicit passes:

**Pass 1 — Hook Hints (before the Algorithm starts)**

The FormatReminder hook runs AI inference on the raw prompt and suggests capabilities, skills, and thinking tools. These are draft suggestions—a head start, not a decision.

**Pass 2 — THINK Validation (after OBSERVE completes)**

With the full context of reverse-engineering and ISC criteria, the THINK phase validates every suggestion. Skills get added, removed, or confirmed. Pass 2 is authoritative.

```
🔍 SKILL CHECK (validate hook hints against ISC):
│ Hook suggested:   CreateSkill:UpdateSkill
│ ISC requires:     Architecture design (not just skill update)
│ Final skills:     CreateSkill:UpdateSkill + Architect consultation
```

**Why two passes?** The hook gives a head start from the raw prompt. But OBSERVE changes the picture. A request that looks like a simple skill update might actually require architectural decisions, or might rest on questionable assumptions that need First Principles analysis. Pass 2 catches what Pass 1 cannot see.

---

### 2. Thinking Tools with Justify-Exclusion

v2.4 had thinking tools (Council, RedTeam, FirstPrinciples, etc.) but they were rarely used because the default was to skip them. v2.5 inverts this: **thinking tools are opt-OUT, not opt-IN.**

For every request, the Algorithm must evaluate each thinking tool and justify why it is NOT being used:

```
🔍 THINKING TOOLS ASSESSMENT (justify exclusion):
│ Council:          EXCLUDE — single clear approach, no alternatives to debate
│ RedTeam:          INCLUDE — proposal could fail in non-obvious ways
│ FirstPrinciples:  INCLUDE — requirement rests on unexamined assumption
│ Science:          EXCLUDE — not iterative/experimental
│ BeCreative:       EXCLUDE — clear requirements, no divergence needed
│ Prompting:        EXCLUDE — not generating prompts
```

The burden of proof is on exclusion. "Too simple" and "already know the answer" are not valid reasons—simple tasks can have hidden assumptions, and confidence without verification is exactly the failure mode this catches.

### The Six Thinking Tools

| Tool | What It Does | Include When |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Council** | Multi-agent debate with 3-7 agents | Multiple valid approaches exist |
| **RedTeam** | Adversarial analysis with 32 agents | Claims need stress-testing |
| **FirstPrinciples** | Deconstruct, challenge, reconstruct | Assumptions need examining |
| **Science** | Hypothesis-test-analyze cycles | Iterative experimentation needed |
| **BeCreative** | Extended thinking, 5 diverse options | Creative divergence needed |
| **Prompting** | Meta-prompting with templates | Prompt optimization needed |

---

### 3. Parallel-by-Default Execution

When the Algorithm identifies independent tasks during BUILD/EXECUTE, they now launch simultaneously as concurrent agents in a single message. Serial execution of independent tasks is a failure mode.

```
BEFORE (v2.4):          AFTER (v2.5):
Task A → wait           Task A ─┐
Task B → wait           Task B ─┼─ all at once
Task C → wait           Task C ─┘
Task D → done           Task D → done
```

**The rule is simple:** If tasks don't depend on each other's output, they run at the same time. Period.

This applies automatically to:
- Multiple file edits with no cross-dependencies
- Multiple research queries on different topics
- Multiple audits or scans of independent systems
- Multiple creation tasks with no shared state

Fan-out is the default pattern for 3+ independent workstreams.

---

## Composition Patterns

Capabilities now combine using 7 named patterns, making orchestration explicit and visible:

| Pattern | Shape | Example | When |
|---------|-------|---------|------|
| **Pipeline** | A → B → C | Explore → Architect → Engineer | Sequential domain handoff |
| **TDD Loop** | A ↔ B | Engineer ↔ QA | Build-verify cycle until ISC passes |
| **Fan-out** | → [A, B, C] | 3 Researchers in parallel | Multiple perspectives needed |
| **Fan-in** | [A, B, C] → D | Researchers → Synthesis | Merging parallel results |
| **Gate** | A → check → B or retry | Engineer → QA → Deploy or fix | Quality gate before progression |
| **Escalation** | A(haiku) → A(sonnet) → A(opus) | Model upgrade on failure | Complexity exceeded model tier |
| **Specialist** | Single A | Pentester for security review | One domain, deep expertise |

The full Capability Selection block in THINK phase now looks like:

```
🎯 CAPABILITY SELECTION:
│ Skills:     CreateSkill:UpdateSkill
│ Thinking:   FirstPrinciples, RedTeam
│ Primary:    Architect  — system design decision (ISC #1)
│ Support:    Engineer   — implementation (ISC #2-4)
│ Verify:     QATester   — browser verification (ISC #5)
│ Pattern:    Pipeline
│ Sequence:   Architect → Engineer → QATester
│ Rationale:  Architecture must be decided before implementation begins
```

## The Goal: Euphoric Surprise

The target remains **Euphoric Surprise**—results so thorough you're genuinely delighted, not just satisfied.

v2.5 makes this more achievable by addressing three weaknesses in v2.4:

1. **Better tool selection** — Two-pass validation means the right capabilities are chosen based on evidence, not habit
2. **Better metacognition** — Thinking tools catch hidden assumptions and unexplored alternatives
3. **Better throughput** — Parallel execution means complex tasks complete faster without sacrificing quality

The Algorithm's hill-climbing loop (define criteria → execute → verify → learn) now has sharper tools at every stage.

---

## Upgrading from v2.4

v2.5 is an incremental upgrade from v2.4. Recommended approach:

```bash
# 1. Backup your current installation
mv ~/.claude ~/.claude-v2.4-backup

# 2. Install v2.5
cp -r .claude ~/

# 3. Run the wizard
cd ~/.claude && bun run INSTALL.ts

# 4. Migrate personal content
# Copy USER/ and MEMORY/ from backup if desired
```

**Breaking changes:**
- `PAIInstallWizard.ts` → `INSTALL.ts` (wizard renamed)
- `skills/CORE/` → `skills/PAI/` (core skill renamed)
- MEMORY directory structure updated
- `settings.json` contextFiles paths updated (wizard handles migration)
