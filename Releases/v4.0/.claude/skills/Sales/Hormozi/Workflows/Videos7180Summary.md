   - `email-marketing-system.md` (Video 77)

   - `1-percent-wealth-guide.md` (Video 73)

3. **Update Existing Files:**
   - `youtube-content.md` - add new video catalog
   - `business-wisdom.md` - add competitive simplicity, stagnation diagnosis
   - `books-and-frameworks.md` - add new frameworks

4. **Verify Against KB:**
