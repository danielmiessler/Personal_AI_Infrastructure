## 🎯 CONTENT STRATEGY

### Twitter-First Testing Approach

**The Process:**
1. Fire from the hip on Twitter (rapid posting of ideas)
2. Team collects best-performing tweets (track engagement metrics)
3. Turn top performers into short-form video scripts
4. Refine and test in video format
5. Distribute across YouTube, Instagram, TikTok

**Why It Works:**
- Twitter provides instant feedback on ideas
- Lowest cost testing platform (text only)
- Best content naturally rises to top through engagement
- Video scripts built on proven concepts

### The 93-7 Principle

**Time Allocation:**
- **7% of time:** Personal content creation (2 days/month)
- **93% outsourced:** Team of editors handles production, distribution, repurposing

**Investment:**
- $20,000/month in production costs
- 2 days/month of Hormozi's personal time
- Team manages 80 posts per week across all platforms

**Key Insight:** "Dedicate only 7% of time to content creation, outsource 93% to a team" - enables massive volume with minimal founder time.

### High-Volume Production

**Output:** 80 posts per week across all platforms

**Distribution Strategy:**
1. Create one long-form video (10-30 minutes)
2. Extract 10-15 short clips (30-90 seconds each)
3. Create quote graphics (5-10)
4. Write threads/posts for each platform
5. Turn into email newsletter
6. Transcribe into blog post

**Result:** 1 hour of content creation → 30+ pieces of content across all platforms

## 📖 CONTENT PHILOSOPHY

### Free Content Strategy

**Core Belief:** "Free content 'this good' means paid is even better. Free content resonates and casts a bigger net for attention."

**Business Model:**
- Provides free content to businesses that can grow to $3M–$5M yearly
- Offers high-potential businesses the opportunity to work with him as portfolio companies
- Content is the funnel, not the profit center

**Why Give Everything Away:**
"If you're starting out, give your stuff away for free. When people say no, ask them why. The reasons they list will be the hidden costs associated with the product or service, and reversing those unlocks value. Oftentimes price isn't the biggest cost."

### Anti-Gatekeeping Approach

**Mission:** Pass on the knowledge that took him time to learn so others can progress faster and surpass him.

**Philosophy:** By sharing what he's learned, he aims to empower those who might make world-changing discoveries.

### Long-Term Greedy vs Short-Term Greedy

**Short-Term Greedy (Most People):**
- Build audience → Sell low-quality products as fast as possible
- Extract maximum value immediately
- Burns trust

**Long-Term Greedy (Hormozi):**
- Build audience → Give massive value for free for years
- Build trust and goodwill
- Eventually make offers to highly engaged audience
- Result: $81M launch of $100M Money Models

**The 4-Year Trust-Building Example:**
- 2021: Hormozi had 2,000 YouTube subscribers
- 2021-2025: Published 500+ podcast episodes, 100+ YouTube videos, 3 books
- Didn't sell anything - just gave value
- Result: When he launched $100M Money Models, massive built-up goodwill converted
