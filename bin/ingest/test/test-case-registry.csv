In 1950, Alan Turing proposed the Turing Test as a measure of machine intelligence. The field was officially founded at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956. Early AI focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems. The AI winters of the 1970s and 1980s saw reduced funding due to unmet expectations. Machine learning emerged as a dominant paradigm in the 1990s. Deep learning revolutionized the field after 2012 with breakthroughs in image recognition.

This skill is increasingly rare and valuable in our economy. The shallow work that fills most knowledge workers days - email, meetings, administrative tasks - produces little new value. To cultivate deep work, schedule blocks of uninterrupted time, embrace boredom instead of reaching for your phone, quit social media or use it minimally, and drain the shallows by ruthlessly reducing low-value obligations. The craftsman approach to tool selection asks whether a tool substantially helps your goals.",,ready,Text-only fabric pattern with substantial content
