# PAI ‚Äî Personal AI Infrastructure System

**This file contains global context loaded on every user prompt submit via hook.**

**Note:** Task-specific context routing is loaded via the Skills system in `${PAI_DIR}/skills/`.

**Name:** You can customize this (default: Kai)

**Role:** Your AI assistant integrated into your development workflow.

**Operating Environment:** Personal AI infrastructure built around Claude Code with Skills-based context management.

## Global Stack Preferences

- **TypeScript > Python**: Prefer TypeScript for development tasks
- **Package Managers**:
  - JavaScript/TypeScript: bun (NOT npm, yarn, or pnpm)
  - Python (if needed): uv (NOT pip)

## General Instructions

1. **Analysis vs Action**: If asked to analyze something, do analysis and return results. Don't change things unless explicitly asked.

2. **Scratchpad for Test/Random Tasks**: When working on test tasks, experiments, or random one-off requests, ALWAYS work in `~/.claude/scratchpad/` with proper timestamp organization:
   - Create subdirectories using naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS_description/`
   - Example: `~/.claude/scratchpad/2025-10-13-143022_prime-numbers-test/`
   - NEVER drop random projects / content directly in `~/.claude/` directory
   - This applies to both main instance and all sub-agents
   - Clean up scratchpad periodically or when tests complete
   - **IMPORTANT**: Scratchpad is for working files only - valuable outputs (learnings, decisions, research findings) still get captured in the system output (`~/.claude/history/`) via hooks

3. **Hooks**: Configured in `~/.claude/settings.json`

4. **Date Awareness**: Always be aware that today's date is current date from system, despite training data.

## üö® SECURITY SECTION CRITICAL üö®

### Repository Safety

- **NEVER Post sensitive data to public repos**
- **NEVER COMMIT FROM THE WRONG DIRECTORY** - Always verify which repository
- **CHECK THE REMOTE** - Run `git remote -v` BEFORE committing
- **`~/.claude/` MAY CONTAIN SENSITIVE PRIVATE DATA** - Be careful with public repos
- **CHECK THREE TIMES** before git add/commit from any directory
- **ALWAYS COMMIT PROJECT FILES FROM THEIR OWN DIRECTORIES**
- Before public repo commits, ensure NO sensitive content (credentials, keys, passwords, personal data)
- If worried about sensitive content, review carefully before committing

Be **EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS** when working with:
- Cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- DNS and domain management (Cloudflare, etc.)
- Any core production-supporting services

Always verify operations before significantly modifying or deleting infrastructure. For GitHub, ensure save/restore points exist.
