# PAI-Boilerplate Testing Guide

## Testing Strategy

This document outlines comprehensive testing procedures for the PAI-Boilerplate plugin to ensure quality and reliability.

---

## Test Environments

### Environment 1: Fresh Installation
- Clean system without `~/.claude/`
- No prior PAI configuration
- Tests new user experience

### Environment 2: Existing Installation
- Existing `~/.claude/` with settings
- Tests migration and compatibility
- Tests upgrade scenarios

---

## Test Suites

### Suite 1: Installation Tests

#### Test 1.1: Fresh Install via Script
```bash
# Prerequisites: Clean ~/.claude/
rm -rf ~/.claude

# Execute
./install.sh

# Expected Results:
âœ… Script completes without errors
âœ… ~/.claude/ directory created
âœ… settings.json created from template
âœ… .mcp.json created from template
âœ… Directory structure created (scratchpad/, context/)
âœ… Configuration prompts work correctly
âœ… User inputs applied to config files
```

#### Test 1.2: Validation
```bash
./scripts/validate-installation.sh

# Expected:
âœ… All checks pass
âœ… No critical errors
```

---

### Suite 2: Component Tests

#### Test 2.1: Agent Loading
```bash
claude

# Test each agent:
"Use the engineer agent to analyze this code"
"Use the architect agent to create a PRD"
"Use the designer agent to design a UI"
"Use the pentester agent to test security"
"Use the researcher agent to find information"

# Expected Results for Each:
âœ… Agent loads without errors
âœ… Agent receives correct tools
âœ… Agent follows instructions
âœ… Response follows expected format
```

#### Test 2.2: Command Execution
```bash
# Test each command:
/conduct-research "test query"
/capture-learning

# Expected Results:
âœ… Command executes without errors
âœ… Produces expected output
âœ… Handles invalid inputs gracefully
```

#### Test 2.3: Skill Activation
```bash
# Test skills:
"Do research on AI" # â†’ research skill
"Create a threat model" # â†’ fabric skill
"Create a pitch" # â†’ alex-hormozi-pitch skill

# Expected Results:
âœ… Skill activates based on intent
âœ… Skill executes correctly
âœ… SKILL.md loaded appropriately
```

#### Test 2.4: Hook Triggering
```bash
# SessionStart hooks:
claude
# Expected: load-core-context.ts and initialize-pai-session.ts execute

# Stop hook:
# Complete task with ðŸŽ¯ COMPLETED line
# Expected: stop-hook.ts executes, voice notification (if enabled)

# Expected:
âœ… Each hook fires on expected event
âœ… Hook scripts execute without errors
âœ… Hooks don't block main execution
```

---

### Suite 3: Configuration Tests

#### Test 3.1: Voice Disabled
```bash
# In ~/.claude/settings.json:
"ENABLE_VOICE": "false"

# Complete a task
# Expected:
âœ… Task completes normally
âœ… No voice notification attempts
âœ… No errors about voice server
```

#### Test 3.2: Voice Enabled, Server Running
```bash
# Start voice server:
cd ~/.claude/voice-server && bun server.ts &

# In settings.json:
"ENABLE_VOICE": "true"

# Complete a task
# Expected:
âœ… Voice notification plays
âœ… Correct voice and rate used
```

#### Test 3.3: Voice Enabled, Server Down
```bash
# Stop voice server:
pkill -f "bun server.ts"

# In settings.json:
"ENABLE_VOICE": "true"

# Complete a task
# Expected:
âœ… Task completes normally
âœ… Graceful failure (no crash)
âœ… 2-second timeout works
```

---

### Suite 4: Path and Variable Tests

#### Test 4.1: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} Resolution
```bash
# Verify:
âœ… No instances of ${PAI_DIR} remain
âœ… All ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} references resolve
âœ… Files load from correct plugin location
âœ… Context templates found
```

#### Test 4.2: hooks.json Schema Validation
```bash
# Verify hooks.json structure:
cat pai-plugin/hooks/hooks.json | jq '.'

# Expected:
âœ… Top-level "hooks" wrapper object exists
âœ… All hook types (SessionStart, Stop, etc.) are inside "hooks" object
âœ… Valid JSON structure with proper nesting
âœ… All command paths use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}
```

#### Test 4.3: Hook Cleanup Validation
```bash
# Check Stop hooks have proper exit handling:
grep -n "process.exit(0)" pai-plugin/hooks/stop-hook.ts
grep -n "process.exit(0)" pai-plugin/hooks/subagent-stop-hook.ts

# Expected:
âœ… stop-hook.ts contains process.exit(0) at end
âœ… subagent-stop-hook.ts contains process.exit(0) at end
âœ… Hooks complete without hanging
```
