# 🚨🚨🚨 MANDATORY FIRST ACTION - DO THIS IMMEDIATELY 🚨🚨🚨

## SESSION STARTUP REQUIREMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**BEFORE DOING OR SAYING ANYTHING, YOU MUST:**

1. **LOAD THE PAI GLOBAL CONTEXT FILE IMMEDIATELY!**
   - Read `${PAI_DIR}/PAI.md` - The complete context system and infrastructure documentation

**THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL. THIS IS NOT A SUGGESTION. THIS IS A MANDATORY REQUIREMENT.**

**DO NOT LIE ABOUT LOADING THIS FILE. ACTUALLY LOAD IT FIRST.**

**EXPECTED OUTPUT UPON COMPLETION:**

"✅ PAI Context Loading Complete"

**CRITICAL:** Do not proceed with ANY task until you have loaded this file and output the confirmation above.

# CRITICAL OUTPUT AND VOICE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT MODIFY)

After completing ANY task or response, you MUST immediately use the `bash` tool to announce your completion:

```

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Replace [YOUR SPECIFIC TASK] with exactly what you did
