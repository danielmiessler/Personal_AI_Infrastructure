## [0.7.0] - 2025-01-XX - Plugin Wrapper Release üéâ

### Major Changes
This release transforms PAI-Boilerplate into a proper Claude Code plugin with clean separation between plugin code and user configuration.

### Added
- **Plugin Structure**: Proper Claude Code plugin manifest with hooks registration
- **Installation Automation**: `install.sh` and `setup.ts` scripts for guided setup
- **Template System**: `settings.example.json` and `.mcp.example.json` templates
- **Voice Configuration**: Optional voice notifications with `ENABLE_VOICE` flag
- **Context Templates**: Template context files in `templates/context/`
- **Comprehensive Documentation**:
  - `INSTALL.md` - Detailed installation guide
  - `QUICKSTART.md` - 5-minute getting started
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Developer guide
  - `TESTING.md` - Test procedures
- **Uninstall Script**: Clean removal with backup
- **Validation Scripts**: Installation verification

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Migrated from `${PAI_DIR}` to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (Claude Code standard)
- **Configuration**: Moved user config out of plugin directory
- **Hooks**: Registered via `hooks/hooks.json` instead of `settings.json`
- **Voice System**: Made fully optional with graceful degradation
- **Agent References**: Updated context paths to use plugin templates
- **Documentation**: Updated all docs for plugin structure

### Removed
- `settings.json` from plugin (replaced with `settings.example.json`)

### Fixed

- Proper path resolution for all components
- Voice server failure no longer blocks execution
- Installation no longer requires manual configuration

### Migration Guide
Users upgrading from 0.6.0:
1. Backup `~/.claude/` directory
2. Run `git pull` to get latest plugin code
3. Update `~/.claude/settings.json` hooks to reference plugin location
4. Replace `${PAI_DIR}` with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` in personal configs

### Changed
