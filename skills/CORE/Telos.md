# TELOS

## DOCUMENT PURPOSE

This document captures my personal context using the TELOS framework so that I, and AI, can better understand who I am and help me improve. The conceptual path is:

**Problems → Mission → Narratives → Goals → Challenges → Strategies → Projects → Journal**

Any project I'm doing can be mapped all the way back up to the problem(s) I'm trying to solve. This gives transparency and explainability in everything I'm doing so I don't end up busy for days/months/years without being able to remember why I'm doing what I'm doing.

## HISTORY

- **Origin**: Ethiopian-American, born to refugees. Grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
- **Family background**:
  - Father was a political refugee who fled Ethiopia after being arrested (released due to a clerical error), fled to Kenya, lived in a refugee camp, then was lucky enough to be among those the US allowed to immigrate
  - Mother was also affected by the Ethiopian war, went to Canada for school, connected with my father, and had me
  - The "miracle of life and geography" required for me to exist and pursue my interests in technology is not lost on me
- **Parents' work**: Mom was a social worker for the City of Minneapolis; Dad was a clerk at the US Postal Service
- **Education**: Moved ~5 times by age 18, attended 6 different schools
  - Tested as gifted but was failed by the system
  - In 5th grade, tested at college-level reading but was placed in remedial (3rd grade level) reading class due to redistricting that moved Black students to a white school
  - A teacher once told me it was "OK if I failed" before a test to skip a grade - undermining confidence
  - School felt like "it didn't really matter, kind of like a crapshoot"
- **Identity**: Geek who loved computers and gaming, but also excelled at sports (basketball, racket sports - still play today)
- **Lifelong friends from high school**: Peter Wilkins, Peter McGinn, Alvan Washington
- **Career path**:
  - Got into crypto in college trying to mine Bitcoin
  - Ethereum's "permissionless unstoppable applications" hooked me - "you could LimeWire any application"
  - **Senior Technical Product Manager at Consensys** - largest Ethereum company. Worked across entire stack (wallets, apps, protocols, network). Built ecosystem network.
  - **Head of Product at ENS** - decentralized naming protocol, core infrastructure for crypto identity. Conducted research on onchain namespaces as agent primitives (identity, resolution, composability, CRUD).
  - **Chief Product Officer at Eliza Labs** - maintainers of elizaOS, one of the most widely-used open source AI agent frameworks. Built DeFi-oriented agents, shaped product direction. https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza
  - Currently: Took time off to explore what's next. Venture Research Partner at Archetype (part-time) evaluating crypto × AI startups.
- **Career insight**: Learned how to ship protocol-level products developers build on, and deliver UX for nascent tech consumers want (even when not fully formed).

## PROBLEMS

**P1: Geography and circumstance determine who gets the opportunity to discover and pursue their interests - and humanity is only mining ~1% of human potential.**

- The "miracle" required to pursue your passions (refugee camp → clerical error → US → technology career) shouldn't be a miracle
- Not purely economic - it's about time sovereignty and pursuing what matters to you
- Current systems tether people to fiscal survival rather than personal capability
- If we only harness 1% of people, we're leaving massive human potential untapped - art, culture, innovation, goodness

**Vision**: Star Trek-like floor - 100% of people get to pursue their talents. Not everyone wants to be a billionaire, but everyone deserves to pursue opportunities and passions. Only limited by personal drive and ambition, not by "fiscal systems of the current context."

**Why capitalism, evolved**: Capitalism enables new industries → more industries → better talent fits. Past: farming. Now: accountants, artists, countless fields. Future: unlimited opportunities we can't yet imagine.

**Worst-case to prevent**:
- AI concentrating power further (dystopian)
- Crypto becoming tool for the wealthy or nation-state surveillance
- Cypherpunk ethos: technology should liberate, not control

---

## MISSION

**M1: Build at the crypto × AI intersection to contribute to a whole new world where people can pursue their ideal selves.**

- Not directly attacking P1, but working from these ideals on transformative technologies
- Solutions manifest through pieces combining - contributing my piece to the cascade
- **Thesis**: AI provides digital abundance (capability, access). Crypto provides digital scarcity (ownership, coordination, incentives). Together = the architecture to democratize opportunity.
- **Wild success**: Credibly neutral systems (like Ethereum) enabling 100% mining of human talent and individual pursuit of ideals
- **AI's role**: Enable and amplify humans to pursue and learn, while keeping human potential and relationships (internal + with others)

## NARRATIVES

**30-second version (party intro):**
> "I'm Eskender, an Ethiopian-American technologist. I grew up in Minneapolis, was CPO at Eliza Labs, Head of Product at ENS, and now exploring the crypto × AI intersection. I believe AI provides digital abundance and crypto provides digital scarcity - and together they're the architecture for a new world where everyone gets to pursue what matters to them."

**Most Important Sentence:**
> "I believe the biggest problem is that geography and circumstance determine who gets the opportunity to discover and pursue their interests, which is why I'm building at the intersection of crypto and AI - because we can build a new world that rejects this."

## GOALS

### Professional (1-3 years)
- **G1**: Build and ship crypto agents that interact with DeFi systems/protocols
- **G2**: Work on open source projects (philosophically aligned, enjoy the ecosystem)
- **G3**: Preferably build in Ethereum ecosystem (most aligned to ideals), but not dogmatic
- **Success metric**: Crypto community talks about and respects the work (like ENS is respected as a protocol) - NOT traditional scaling metrics (users/revenue)

### Personal
- **G4**: Fix health issues - weak stomach, shoulder problems, overweight from sitting too much
- **G5**: Focus on relationships
- **G6**: Start a family
- **G7**: Flexibility on location (NYC now, open to moving, travels a lot)

### Stretch
- **G8**: Own the Minnesota Timberwolves - operate a team, draft players, develop them, be GM/owner

---

## CHALLENGES

- **C1**: Landing on the right problem + finding motivated collaborators
  - Can ship simple agents as a product person
  - Advanced agents require team with deep RL/context engineering
  - Has capital but hiring isn't exciting - wants a motivated team

- **C2**: Isolation and motivation as solopreneur
  - Gets energy from working on a team with momentum
  - Could make money as investor (systems thinker, good at long/short bets) but it doesn't excite me

- **C3**: Tendency to rest and be in my head
  - Sit a lot, like to lay and rest even when not tired
  - In my head a lot, let mind wander
  - Want to be more active physically AND mentally - move outside own world

- **C4**: Internal dedication, not external blockers
  - Don't feel blocked by market, funding, network, tools
  - Could navigate any of those
  - Real blocker: dedicating to a plan/process that enables external factors to amplify

- **C5**: Discipline around health
  - Can be undisciplined around health and hygiene

---

## STRATEGIES

**S1 for C1 (problem + collaborators):**
- Using VC role at Archetype as deal flow for potential teams/collaborators
- Open to hackathons, Twitter, existing projects, co-founder matching
- Increase exposure surface area through these channels

**S2 for C2 (isolation/motivation):**
- **What gives energy**: Building software, crafting solutions, working with pace and momentum
- **What works**: Being around people who want momentum and push
- **Pattern**: I leave when momentum ceilings appear - find environments without political/social blockers
- Optimize for high-momentum teams, not prestigious ones

**S3 for C3 (resting/in head):**
- No current strategy - open to experimentation
- Potential: Scheduled "do" blocks vs "think" blocks, environment changes, body doubling

**S4 for C4 (dedication):**
- Discipline is the gap - start but don't follow through
- Potential: External accountability, public commitment, smaller bets with faster feedback

**S5 for C5 (health):**
- **What's worked**: Long walks + podcasts, basketball, fasting
- Replicate what works - schedule these consistently

## METRICS

- Crypto community engagement with my work (mentions, respect, collaboration requests)
- Health: weight, physical activity frequency, energy levels
- Collaborator pipeline: meaningful conversations with potential co-founders/teammates
- Shipping: things built and released (open source contributions, tools, products)

---

## IDEAS

- Technology is a force for good (many people disagree)
- Two-party system is good - forces compromise, oscillates between median view better than 30 parties arguing
- Crypto × AI is the future, not a scam - they intertwine (AI = abundance, crypto = scarcity)
- Ethereum is the system most closely aligned to my ideals (credibly neutral, permissionless)

---

## PREDICTIONS

- Coding will be a commodity (high confidence)
- China will be the dominant world power in the next 30 years (high confidence)
  - Automated factories and technology integration into society is a systemic advantage
  - US individualism will be a blocker even if they have better models

---

## THINGS I'VE BEEN WRONG ABOUT

- Nothing obvious comes to mind that makes me feel bad - not that I haven't been wrong, just nothing specific that stands out

---

## WISDOM

- Self-guided - I don't draw much from external counsel or "dead authors"
- I think about the future for myself
- The beauty of capitalism is you can push your personal capabilities to the extreme
- "The future of work we deserve will be the one that we build"

---
