## Hormozi Value Equation (Core Framework)

```
Value = (Dream Outcome x Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) /
        (Time Delay x Effort & Sacrifice)
```

**To increase value:**
- Increase dream outcome (what they get)
- Increase perceived likelihood (certainty it works)
- Decrease time delay (faster results)
- Decrease effort & sacrifice (easier to achieve)

## Guarantee Framework

- **Unconditional** - Full refund, no questions
- **Conditional** - Refund if specific conditions met
- **Anti-guarantee** - "No refunds because this works"
- **Implied** - Social proof that removes perceived risk
