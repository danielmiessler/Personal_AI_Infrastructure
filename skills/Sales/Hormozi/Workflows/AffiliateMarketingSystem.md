**Case Study:** $100M Money Models book launch ($81M revenue, 2.9M copies)
**Date Added:** October 29, 2025
**Category:** Lead generation and partnership frameworks

## Overview

This is Hormozi's complete affiliate marketing system, battle-tested with the biggest book launch in history ($81M in revenue). The system generated 2.9 million book sales through strategic affiliate partnerships.

**Key Principle:** Win-Win-Win structure (Customer wins, Affiliate wins, You win)

---

## Two-Tiered Affiliate Structure

**Concept:** Create two parallel affiliate programs—one for money, one for non-monetary incentives.

### Tier 1: Money-Based Affiliates

**Who:** Professional marketers, influencers with large audiences, agencies
**Incentive:** Cash commission per sale
**Typical Commission:** 30-50% of sale price
**Why They Promote:** Direct financial gain

**Example from $100M Money Models:**
- $40 book price
- $12-20 commission per sale
- Large affiliates made $50K-$500K+

### Tier 2: Non-Monetary Affiliates

**Who:** Customers, fans, small audiences, mission-aligned partners
**Incentive:** Recognition, status, exclusive access, impact
**Typical Rewards:**
- Leaderboard rankings
- Exclusive content
- Direct access to you
- Public recognition
- Community status

**Example from $100M Money Models:**
- Top promoter leaderboard
- Behind-the-scenes access
- Recognition in launch content
- Community leadership roles

**Why This Works:**

Some people are motivated by money, others by status/mission. Two tiers = capture both groups.

---

## Affiliate Offer Construction

**Framework:** Decide if your affiliate program is money-based or mission-based, then structure accordingly.

### Money vs. Non-Monetary Decision Tree

**Choose MONEY-BASED if:**
- High ticket product ($500+)
- Professional marketer audience
- You have profit margin for commissions
- Need immediate scale

**Choose NON-MONETARY if:**
- Low ticket product (<$100)
- Customer/fan audience
- Tight profit margins
- Building long-term community

**Choose BOTH if:**
- You want maximum reach
- Can afford commission structure
- Have mission-aligned message
- Want both pro marketers AND grassroots promotion

**Hormozi's Choice:** BOTH (money for pros, recognition for fans)

---

**Required Elements:**

### 1. Why This Offer (Value Proposition)

## Affiliate Activation Metrics by Channel

**Concept:** Different channels have different activation rates. Plan accordingly.

### Email Lists

**Expected Activation:** 30-50% of affiliates with email lists will promote
**Why:** Low effort, they already email audience regularly
**Support Needed:** Email templates, subject line variations

### Social Media

**Expected Activation:** 20-40% of social media affiliates will promote
**Why:** Must fit their content style, requires more customization
**Support Needed:** Platform-specific content (IG stories, TikTok format, Twitter threads)

### YouTube/Podcast

**Expected Activation:** 10-30% will promote
**Why:** Higher production effort, must fit their content calendar
**Support Needed:** Talking points, video clips, ad read scripts

### Blog/Content Sites

**Expected Activation:** 40-60% will promote
**Why:** Evergreen content, easy to add affiliate links
**Support Needed:** Blog post templates, SEO keywords, embed codes

**Planning:** If you recruit 100 affiliates with email lists, expect 30-50 to actually promote. Recruit accordingly.

## Core Four Applied to Affiliate Acquisition

**Concept:** Use your own Core Four framework to recruit affiliates.

### Warm Outreach (Recruiting Affiliates)

**Who to Contact:**
- Existing customers (they already love you)
- People who engage with your content
- Past collaborators
- Industry peers

**Message:**
"You've been a fan of my work. I'm launching [product] and would love your help spreading it. Interested in partnering?"

### Cold Outreach (Recruiting Affiliates)

**Who to Contact:**
- Influencers in your niche
- Complementary business owners
- Professional affiliates/marketers

**Message:**
"I follow your work on [topic]. I'm launching [product] that your audience would love. Would you be open to a partnership where you earn [commission]?"

### Free Content (Attracting Affiliates)

**Strategy:**
- Create "Affiliate opportunity" content
- Post about launch publicly
- Share affiliate success stories
- Make the opportunity visible

**Where:**
- Social posts about affiliate program
- YouTube video about partnership opportunity
- Blog post with affiliate signup

### Paid Ads (Attracting Affiliates)

**Strategy:**
- Run ads targeting "affiliate marketers"
- Run ads targeting "[your topic] influencers"
- Retarget your existing audience with affiliate opportunity

**Ad Message:**
"Want to earn promoting products you believe in? Join my affiliate program."

---

## Affiliate Terminology Mapping (Industry-Specific)

**Concept:** Different industries call affiliates different things. Use the right term.

**Affiliate Marketing =**
- "Partners" (business/B2B)
- "Ambassadors" (consumer brands)
- "Collaborators" (creative industries)
- "Promoters" (events/launches)
- "Referral partners" (professional services)

**Commission =**
- "Partnership fee" (sounds more professional)
- "Revenue share" (equity-like framing)
- "Referral bonus" (lighter weight)

**Why This Matters:** Some audiences are turned off by "affiliate marketing" language. Reframe for your market.

---

## Affiliate-Specific Content Tailoring

**Concept:** Create different promotion angles for different affiliate audiences.

### Example from $100M Money Models Launch

**For Business Owners:**
"This book will show you how to structure your business for maximum cash flow."

**For Aspiring Entrepreneurs:**
"This is the blueprint to start your first business and make your first million."

**For Sales Professionals:**
"Learn the frameworks behind $100M+ in sales."

**For Marketing Professionals:**
"See the exact strategies we used to build a 9-figure portfolio."

**For Self-Improvement Audience:**
"Transform your relationship with money and wealth building."

**Strategy:** Give affiliates angle options that match their audience. Same product, different framing.

---

## Win-Win-Win Principle

**Concept:** Structure everything so all three parties benefit.

### Customer Wins

**What They Get:**
- Valuable product at fair price
- Bonuses (if available)
- Trusted recommendation from affiliate they follow
- Solution to their problem

### Affiliate Wins

**What They Get:**
- Commission/recognition
- Value to provide their audience
- Strengthened relationship with audience (helped them)
- Low effort (you provide all materials)

### You Win

**What You Get:**
- Massive distribution
- Sales/revenue
- Social proof (affiliates endorsing you)
- Long-term affiliate relationships

**Key:** If any party doesn't win, the system breaks. Design for all three.

---

## Leaderboard Gamification Strategy

**Concept:** Create public leaderboard for affiliate rankings to drive competition.

### Leaderboard Structure

**Tracked Metrics:**
- Total sales generated
- Total revenue generated
- Number of unique customers
- Engagement rate

**Display:**
- Real-time leaderboard (live updates)
- Public rankings (top 10-20 visible)
- Badges/tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum)

### Prize Structure

**Prizes for Top Performers:**
- Cash bonuses ($1K-$100K+ depending on scale)
- Exclusive experiences (dinner with you, mastermind access)
- Public recognition (featured in content)
- Lifetime status (VIP in community)

**Example from $100M Money Models:**
- Top affiliate earned $500K+ in commissions
- Top 10 got exclusive dinner with Hormozi
- Top 100 got featured in launch recap content

### Psychological Drivers

Leaderboard triggers:
- **Competition** - "I want to beat [person above me]"
- **Recognition** - "I want to be in top 10"
- **FOMO** - "I'm falling behind, need to push harder"
- **Status** - "Being #1 proves I'm the best"

---

## Behind-the-Scenes Transparency Strategy

**Concept:** Share the entire affiliate system publicly to attract more affiliates and build trust.

### What to Share

**Revenue Numbers:**
- Total sales generated
- Top affiliate earnings
- Your total revenue

**Process Details:**
- How you built affiliate program
- What worked/didn't work
- Lessons learned

**Affiliate Stories:**
- How top affiliates promoted
- What strategies worked best
- Real examples of promotion

### Why This Works

**Attracts New Affiliates:**
"If [person] made $50K promoting this, I can too"

**Builds Trust:**
Transparency = credibility = more people want to partner

**Creates Meta-Content:**
The video explaining your affiliate program becomes content itself (like this video from Hormozi)

**Example:** Hormozi's "Copy This Strategy" video explaining his affiliate system generated 238K views and likely recruited hundreds of new affiliates for future launches.
