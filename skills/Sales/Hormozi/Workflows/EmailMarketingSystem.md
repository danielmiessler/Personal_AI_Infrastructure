**Tactics:**
- LinkedIn: "I created a free guide on [topic]. Want me to email it?"

- Industry forums: Provide value, offer email follow-up

**Conversion:** 5-15% will subscribe if offer is valuable

## Email Welcome Sequence Framework

**Purpose:** Convert new subscribers into engaged readers and eventual buyers

### The 7-Email Welcome Sequence

**Email 1 (Send immediately): Deliver Lead Magnet + Set Expectations**

**Subject:** "Here's your [Lead Magnet Name]"

**Content:**
- Deliver the promised lead magnet
- Set expectations: "You'll get emails from me [frequency]"
- Tell them what to expect: "I share [type of content]"
- Personal story: "Why I created this"
- Soft CTA: "Reply if you have questions"

**Goal:** Establish trust, set tone

**Email 2 (Day 1): Who I Am / Origin Story**

**Subject:** "How I [achieved result] (my story)"

**Content:**
- Your background
- Why you're qualified to teach this
- Personal struggles and wins
- "I'm here to help you avoid my mistakes"

**Goal:** Build credibility and connection

**Email 3 (Day 2): What I Believe / Philosophy**

**Subject:** "The [Framework Name] that [Benefit]"

**Content:**
- Teach valuable framework
- Step-by-step breakdown
- Real example/application
- No pitch, pure value

**Goal:** Demonstrate expertise

**Email 6 (Day 7): Soft Pitch / Bridge to Offer**

**Subject:** "Ready for the next level?"

**Content:**
- "You've learned [what they learned in sequence]"
- "If you want to go deeper, here's how I can help"
- Introduce your paid offer (don't hard sell)
- "No pressure, just letting you know it exists"

**Goal:** Introduce offer without being pushy

**Email 7 (Day 10): Full Pitch / Clear CTA**

**Subject:** "Here's exactly how to [achieve result]"

**Content:**
- Problem → Solution framework
- Your offer solves their problem
- Clear pricing and what's included
- Strong CTA: "Click here to [action]"
- Urgency/scarcity (if genuine)

**Goal:** Convert to customer

**Conversion Goal:** 3-10% of subscribers buy during welcome sequence

---

## Regular Email Content Strategy

**After welcome sequence:** Shift to regular emails

### Email Frequency

**Hormozi's Recommendation:** Minimum 3x per week, optimal 5-7x per week

**Why High Frequency:**
- More touchpoints = stronger relationship
- You stay top-of-mind
- You train audience to expect/open your emails
- More opportunities to sell

**Common Fear:** "I'll annoy people and they'll unsubscribe"
**Reality:** People who unsubscribe from frequency weren't buyers anyway. Buyers want MORE.

### Email Content Types (Rotate These)

**Type 1: Value/Education (60% of emails)**

**Format:**
- Teach framework or concept
- Share case study
- Break down strategy
- Actionable tactical content

**Goal:** Build trust and authority

**Example:**
"Subject: The 3-Step Framework for Doubling Your Close Rate
Body: Here's exactly how to structure discovery calls..."

**Type 2: Story/Personal (20% of emails)**

**Format:**
- Personal story with lesson
- Behind-the-scenes of your business
- Failure/success story
- Vulnerable share

**Goal:** Build connection and relatability

**Example:**
"Subject: I almost quit last Tuesday (here's what happened)
Body: Sat in my car at 2am questioning everything..."

**Type 3: Pitch/Offer (20% of emails)**

**Format:**
- Direct product/service promotion
- Launch announcement
- Special offer
- Webinar registration

**Goal:** Drive revenue

**Example:**
"Subject: This closes tomorrow at midnight
Body: If you've been waiting to join [program]..."

## Email Copywriting Frameworks

### Framework 1: PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)

**Problem:** Identify their pain point
**Agitate:** Make them feel it deeply
**Solution:** Present your offer as the solution

**Example:**
```
PROBLEM: "You're working 60 hours a week but your business isn't growing."

AGITATE: "Every day you wake up at 5am. You hustle until 9pm. You're exhausted.
Your family barely sees you. And for what? Revenue is flat. You're stuck."

SOLUTION: "Here's what's actually wrong: [your framework]. And here's how to fix it: [your offer]."
```

### Framework 2: AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)

**Attention:** Grab them with compelling subject + opening
**Interest:** Hook them with intriguing information
**Desire:** Make them want what you're offering
**Action:** Clear CTA to take next step

**Example:**
```
ATTENTION: Subject: "The $100M sales script (steal this)"

INTEREST: "I've closed $100M+ using this exact script. It works for any industry."

DESIRE: "Imagine never fumbling objections again. Imagine closing 2x more deals with
the same effort. This script does that."

ACTION: "Click here to get the script →"
```

### Framework 3: Before-After-Bridge

**Before:** Their current painful situation
**After:** The ideal situation they want
**Bridge:** Your offer gets them from Before to After

**Example:**
```
BEFORE: "Right now you're manually handling every customer, working 12-hour days,
and you're the bottleneck."

AFTER: "Imagine: Your team handles 90% of delivery. You focus on sales and strategy.
You work 6-hour days and revenue is up 3x."

BRIDGE: "The bridge between these two realities is systematization. Here's how
I can help you build those systems in 90 days..."
```
